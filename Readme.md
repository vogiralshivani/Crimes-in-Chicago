Steps to run the code and use the datasets:

1)	Unzip the csv data file named ‘Chicago_Crime-2019-20121.csv.zip’

2)	Use the data file and run the code file named ‘Data-preprocessing.Rmd’

3)	After the above Rmd file is run, a new preprocessed data file is generated which is named ‘crimes_data_2019.csv’

4)	The above generated data file is then loaded into the ‘FinalProject.Rmd’ for the further analysis on the reduced data
