## Objective:

In this project we are trying to analyze the proportion of arrests made for a particular crime after it was reported to the Chicago Police Department. There are various variables in the dataset such as crime type, location, arrest made etc. Our goal is to predict whether the arrest was made or not for a particular crime depending on the other variables in the dataset like crime type, location, month, day, etc.
Theft is the most common property crime and assault is the most common violent crime in Chicago, according to reports most of these crimes go unsolved. This would make us think does the crime type and the location of the crime matter for a case to be marked solved in the city of Chicago? Perhaps this can be analyzed by understanding the interactions between location and crime type and other factors such as the month, weekday of the crime reported.
There are so many records and documentation in the police department that have been gathered during the years, which can be used as a valuable source of data for the data analytics tasks. Applying analytical task to these data bring us valuable information that can be used to increase the safety of our society and lower the crime rate.


## Steps to run the code and use the datasets:

1)	Unzip the csv data file named ‘Chicago_Crime-2019-20121.csv.zip’

2)	Use the data file and run the code file named ‘Data-preprocessing.Rmd’

3)	After the above Rmd file is run, a new preprocessed data file is generated which is named ‘crimes_data_2019.csv’

4)	The above generated data file is then loaded into the ‘FinalProject.Rmd’ for the further analysis on the reduced data
